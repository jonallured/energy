## Using index files

In general we avoid using index files except for the cases where something is going to be treated as a package.

In the case of `energy` this applies to the following folders:

`palette` : Shared palette with eigen
`sharedUI` : things that are reused between energy

`shared/utils` : Shared is a folder that contains everything we share with eigen
`shared/tests`
`shared/hooks`
